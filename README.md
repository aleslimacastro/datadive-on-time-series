# Contribution to the Münster Datadive On Time Series Competition

## About the repository content
This is the jupyter notebook code that we used to place 4th in the DataScience Münster Meetup DataDive Hackathon in 10/2016.
The goal of the Kaggle Competition was to predict visitors of the Nettebad in Osnabrück.
Sadly the dataset license does not match our license, so there is no input data here, just the prediction code.

## Requirements
Python (tested with 2.7 and 3.5), jupyter notebook, scikit-learn and pandas.
